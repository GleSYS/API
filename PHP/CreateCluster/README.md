This is a simple example on how to automatically create a server cluster using GleSYS API.
The examples fetches a reserved IP, creates a loadbalancer, a number of servers and adds the servers to the loadbalancer.

The next step would be to install software needed on the servers, this could be done by using the https://github.com/GleSYS/wp-auto-deploy
The code should be self explanatory.

The API key will need to have access rights to IP, loadbalancer and server.
